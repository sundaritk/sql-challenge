# sql-challenge

format for config ini file for the bonus question. Without this the script wont run.

[postgresql]
host=localhost
database=EmployeeSQL
user=postgres
password=yourpassword



## Data Modeling
  Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.

## Data Engineering

* Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
  Once you have a complete database, do the following:

  * List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
  * List employees who were hired in 1986.
  * List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
  * List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  * List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
  * List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  * List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  * In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

## Bonus (Optional)
As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:

  * Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) This step may require some research. Feel free to use the code below to get started. Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name:
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost:5432/<your_db_name>')
connection = engine.connect()

* Consult SQLAlchemy documentation for more information.

1. If using a password, do not upload your password to your GitHub repository. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I and https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/ for more information.
2. Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.
3. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.
